# Tauri V1 Micro Demo

## Overview

This repository features a minimalistic Tauri V1 application for testing and demonstrating the [okcodes/tauri-build](https://github.com/okcodes/tauri-build) and [okcodes/tauri-updater](https://github.com/okcodes/tauri-updater) GitHub Actions.

The application itself is intentionally minimalistic, performing no specific function other than to be built and updated rapidly.
